          Inner catalog is a website where individual, circles, groups to share
          their work and found each other before convention.

          This is an alternative from comifuro{' '}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.comifuro.net/">
            catalog.comifuro.net
          </a>
          , but not solely for comifuro. I would gradually add more convention
          to the list based on your suggestion
